After searching for practical tools, I finally found them and here are some discoveries!

The following 2 tools are similar but have a different operating system. Choose the one that suits you best.





# Unsuscriber

**Concept** : The concept of Unsuscriber is to *easily block* all the emails you no longer wish to receive.

***How?*** After registering on the platform, a folder will be created in your mailbox. After that, you will only have to deposit the unwanted emails in this folder and *automatically,* the platform will block future emails.

***Note :***\
Behind this whole process, the platform takes care of informing the authors of the emails to stop sending you emails. During the time this is done, the emails are automatically put in the platform folder in your mailbox.

*In addition*, the platform is available on all types of devices.





# Cleanfox

<!--StartFragment-->

In the same register as Unsuscriber, there is Cleanfox. The final goal is similar: *no more emails you don’t want anymore and make your work easier so you don’t waste time unsubscribing yourself.*

***Concept :*** The difference between Cleanfox and Unsusciber is that the process is not exactly the same.\
Unsuscriber created a folder and managed all this on his own. Cleanfox, deals with the problem differently.

Indeed, for a few seconds, the application **analyzes your mailbox** and email address and *detects* all newsletters and services where your email address is registered. After these seconds, it offers in a **clear interface**, for each service, ***3** options*: delete the mails associated with the service in question, delete the mails and unsubscribe, and finally do nothing so keep it as it is currently.

***Note :***\
In addition, with this, you contribute to tree plantations ***to protect the environment*** since Cleanfox supports Green Cross.

> Did you know? Each year, all emails stored in the mailboxes of people living on Earth pollute more than the kerosene of all the planes together!

Now, let’s move on to another very powerful tool : 



# Mailtrack

# [Mailtrack](https://mailtrack.io/)

***Concept :***\
Mailtrack is a great tool to be more ***productive*** and manage your exchanges with people by email more easily. Indeed, the application allows you to **track the email you sent**. This way, you know in *real time* with notifications *when* the mail is opened, *from* which device, where, *how* many times. You are more aware of when your emails are open. With this, you ensure **a better follow-up** of your emails.

*In addition*, the person receiving the message is not aware that you can track your email, which is more convenient so as not to create conflict or other problems. Only you know about it.

You can also track the activity of your emails using a dashboard to get a better overview and the possibility to have a log report.

***Note :*** It works on both computers and telephones.



# Conclusion

These three applications will allow you to improve your efficiency by

* not receiving more messages than you want
* being able to track the status of the message you have sent.

On a daily basis, these 3 applications allow you to gain in **efficiency** due to greater **clarity** in your emails and **better follow-up**.

> I would also like to remind you of something important:
>
> By using one of the first two services, you can not only save yourself time but also **protect the planet** by helping to limit digital pollution.
