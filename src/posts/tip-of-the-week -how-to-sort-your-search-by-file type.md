Sometimes we are looking for specific documents on the web: a pdf, an excel, a word etc.

\
Few people use the shortcut, which is *useful* and *saves a lot of time*!

\
For example, if I want to find a report on food and children, I can search on Google … but you can also decide to display only PDFs and not all the results …. which will allow you to sort and reach the reports faster.

> 👉 The shortcut on Google: “{query} filetype:pdf”

\
If you want to find : \
word document => doc\
excel => xlsx



**P.S**: internal company documents in pdf that are usually not accessible to the general public can be found just by using the filter sometimes ...😅😮
