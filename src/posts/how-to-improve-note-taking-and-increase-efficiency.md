Last year, I discovered a simple tool but highly effective who literally change my life, as a student. I’m so sad to see that a little number of people use this great tool.

## The problem of our society with slideshow :

In the 21st century, computers are gradually replacing hands for taking notes. On the paper, It’s great to do things faster and smarter than before with great tools on the computer.\
But, for a majority of people, there is one thing that computer don’t permit today: ***taking notes smarter*** during a speech with a slide show. Yes! Computers are great, I’m not denying that. But, the problem is the organization of the notes.

Most people write notes in note software. The ***big problem*** is when people want to review their notes, they read what they wrote but they don’t remember which slide was with their words. So, they are lost in their notes and the memorization is bad. In fact, all the meaning of the slides is lost because people don’t have the slideshow with her when they review their notes.

> The problem is very important in particular for students because they see a slideshow all day long.

But, if I explain that, it’s because I’ve found the solution by looking for hours and hours in the large space that is the Internet.



## The solution

So, a student at University of Liège, *Adrien Fery*, who was concerned about the problem, decided to find a solution. He built a very effective software for people who take notes, the most concerned being students: Amanote

The concept of **Amanote** is very simple : on the left side of the screen, the slide corresponding to the one projected, and on the right side of the screen, a space for taking notes.\
When a person looks at the slide number 5, the notes of the slide 5 are on the right side and, when she looks at the slide 17, she had the notes of the slide 17. It’s simple but very handy.



> Try it ! You will not regret it



## Why is so revolutionary ?

Perhaps you will say me It’s not as revolutionary as it sounds. You’re right but no one did what this computer student built.

And you know what? People who have used (include me) this software are remarkably surprised at the effectiveness. I can say you that it changes life as a student. Everything is so **organized** that you can’t imagine taking some notes without this tool.

They are 3 majors reasons why you should use this solution :

* You can improve your note-taking method
* You can get a better result on the short & long-term
* You can be more **efficient** and **save time**

Furthermore, you have a lot of functionality like exporting your notes to PDF format and use the audio recording.

## And me ?

If I decided to present this tool today, It’s for **two reasons**: first, this solution helped me to perform on my exams and I’m sure that it can for a lot of people. Second, I’m so sad to see how this software is *not well known* to the general public whereas it is great.

***Questions ? Comments ? I’m curious to know what you think about it*.**
